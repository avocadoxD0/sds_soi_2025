# Reaction Wheel Attitude Control System

This repository contains the complete design and development of a single-axis reaction wheel system for satellite attitude stabilization. The project brings together mechanical modeling, circuit design, and embedded control to achieve angular velocity detumbling.

The system is built around a reaction wheel mechanism, controlled using real-time feedback from an onboard IMU. All major subsystems including mechanical structure, electronics, and control algorithm are developed in coordination to function as a unified, self-contained system.

This repository serves as a consolidated record of the entire design process, including CAD models, PCB design files, and control code.
